# Assets & Licenses

This document enumerates the assets bundled with the FocusFlow application and their respective licenses.

## Icons & Illustrations

The app icon (`assets/icon.png`) and the splash image (`assets/splash.png`) were generated specifically for FocusFlow using a generative art tool. They do not depict any real‑world trademarks or copyrighted material and are released into the public domain (CC0).

Category images (`assets/nature.png`, `assets/noise.png`, `assets/music.png`) are abstract illustrations generated by an AI tool. They contain no identifiable people or proprietary imagery and are released under CC0.

## Audio

`assets/chime.wav` is a synthetic sine‑wave tone generated programmatically. It is an original work created for this application and is released under CC0. It may be replaced with any other Creative Commons‑licensed notification sound at the developer’s discretion.

## Fonts

FocusFlow uses the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) typeface, which is licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). The font files are fetched via the `@expo-google-fonts/inter` package during installation.
